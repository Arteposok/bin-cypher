Take the coordinates of a letter,
you should write them in binary
and for all 1-bits substitute
the letter from the key that
corresponds with it's part
and place value.
key used = abc def (only a-f allowed)
1. C | 2. C=3-1 | 3. 3-1 = 011-001
4. 011-001 = bc-f (only the letters
that would correspond to 1-bits
if written underneath)
5. take the next key from the key list
and apply to the next letter the same way
