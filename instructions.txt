You take the coordinates of a letter,
write them in binary, substitute key
letters for corresponding place values
excoding 1-bits for the x and y
1. Write out plaintext: e.g: CAT
2. Get a the FIRST key from the 
keylist, find example below:
    abc def
    fab cde
    efa bcd ...
+the fist part of the key corresponds
to x-axis and second to y-axis
same as the unencripted version.
+only letters a-f are allowed in key
thus key(first) = abc def
3. Write coordinates: (3,1): 3-1
4. Write binary coordinates
3 = 011
1 = 001
5. Use key
011-001
 ||   |
abc-def
bc-f
6. Encrypt the next letter with the
next key in the keylist until it runs
out, then start from the beginning again
